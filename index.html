            <p>My favorite book is 'The Graveyard Book' by Neil Gaiman, because it has an interesting plot, fun characters, and because I can't put it down. The summary of the book is, "Bod is an unusual boy who inhabits an unusual place-he's the only living resident of a graveyard. Raised from infancy by the ghosts, werewolves, and other cemetery denizens, Bod has learned the antiquated customs of his guardians' time as well as their timely ghostly teachings-like the ability to Fade. Can a boy raised by ghosts face the wonders and terrors of the worlds of both the living and the dead? And then there are things like ghouls that aren't really one thing or the other. This chilling tale is Neil Gaiman's first full-length novel for middle-grade readers since the internationally bestselling and universally acclaimed Coraline. Like Coraline, this book is sure to enchant and surprise young readers as well as Neil Gaiman's legion of adult fans." I bet you can see why it it so alluring now, right? This book has many twists and turns, and always leaves you wanting to find out what happens next. It also has slow-paced moments, which makes an interesting book. </p>

            <p> My favorite character in the book is the main character, Nobody "Bod" Owens. I like him because he is brave (or maybe just desensitized), trusting, and smart. Additionally, his character arc and development is also very good, as he recognizes the ghosts who raised him as his family.

                My second favorite character in the book is Bod's childhood (human) friend, Scarlett Amber Perkins. She has a strong sense of ethics, and like Bod, she is also very smart, but she does not have the advantage of being able to see ghosts. Though she and Bod fall out of contact at the book, she is the reason many things in the book happen, and she is the reason for a lot of Bod's character development.
